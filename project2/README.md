The topology recognition problem ​ can be formulated as follows:

input: n, a positive integer, and a two-dimensional matrix W of integer values.

output: a message stating either “ring” for ring topology, ”star” for star topology, “complete” for fully
connected mesh, or “neither” if the weight matrix does not represent either of these three topologies
The topology recognition problem is solvable in polynomial time. You need to find out the exact time
complexity and prove it.
